Welcome to class! This website is designed to accompany Mason Garrison's Psych Methods for Psych Minors (PMPM). This class is a undergraduate-level psychology course at Wake Forest University. I encourage anyone who is methods-curious to work their way through these course notes.  The course notes include lectures, worked examples, readings, activities, and labs. You can find the current version of the course syllabus [here][course_syllabus], along with all of the [other syllabi for my classes][syllabi]. All the embedded lecture videos can be found on a [youtube playlist][pl_all].
