This website is designed to accompany Mason Garrisons Introduction to Personality Psychology. This class is a undergraduate-level psychology course at Wake Forest University. I encourage anyone who is personality-curious to work their way through these course notes. The course notes include lectures, worked examples, readings, activities, and labs. You can find the current version of the course syllabus along with all of the other syllabi for my classes here. All the embedded lecture videos can be found on a youtube playlist. Mason Notes This website is constantly changing. This new course is in active development, and approximately 100% done. I have made this process explicitly transparent because I want you to see how you can use R to produce some pretty neat things. Indeed, Ive included the source code for this website in the class github. I encourage you to contribute to the course code. If you catch typos, errors, please issue a pull request with the fixes. If you find cool / useful resources, please add them. By the end of the semester, I would love for everyone to have contributed to the course materials. It can be as simple as adding a course request to the wishlist. I believe that it is useful skill to be able to do. How to use these notes This document is broken down into multiple chapters. Use the table of contents on the left side of the screen to navigate, and use the hamburger icon (horizontal bars) at the top of the document to open or close the table of contents. At the top of the document, youll see additional icons which you can click to search the document, change the size, font or color scheme of the page. The document will be updated (unpredictably) throughout the semester. Every module corresponds to a weeks worth of material. Most modules are dedicated to a specific theme. Within each module, there are embedded videos, slides, activities, labs, and tutorials. The skills developed in each module build upon skills youve developed in previous modules. Eventually, this class will have more modules available than weeks in a semester, so that you  the reader can choose your own adventure (err module) youd like to start with. Although these notes share some of the features of a textbook, they are neither comprehensive nor completely original. The main purpose is to give you all a set of common materials on which to draw during the course. In class, we will sometimes do things outside the notes. The idea here is that you will read the materials and try to learn from them, just as you will attend classes and try to learn from them. Status of course In terms of timing, I will have each module completed by the start of the week. The start of the week will be Monday at 12 p.m. EST. It is possible that I will get ahead of this deadline. You can see the current status of the course below. Although you are welcome to work ahead, be aware that I will be making changes to modules that havent officially started yet. In addition, I may add optional materials to previous modules that might be helpful. This table provides the current status of the course. It lists proportions of specific components by module. Overall it is 100% complete. "],["attribution.html", "Attribution Major Attributions Additional Attributions", " Attribution This class leans heavily on other peoples materials and ideas.

Data Science for Psychologists (CN4P) introduces on the principles of data science, including: data wrangling, modeling, visualization, and communication. In this class, we link those principles to psychological methods and open science practices by emphasizing exploratory analyses and description, rather than confirmatory analyses and prediction. Through the semester we will work our way thru Wickham and Grolemunds R for Data Science text and develop proficiency with tidyverse. This class emphasizes replication and reproducibility. CN4P is a practical skilled-based class and should be useful to students aiming for academia as well as those interested in industry. Applications of these methods can be applied to a full range of psychological areas, including perception (e.g, eye-tracking data), neuroscience (e.g., visualizing neural networks), and individual differences (e.g., valence analysis). 0.1 Big Ideas This class covers the following broad five areas: Reproducibility; Replication; Robust Methods; Resplendent Visualizations; and R Programming. 0.2 Course Modality This class is a blended class. The online portions are asynchronous, and often contain pre-recorded videos. Ive created a video highlighting how to be a successful asynchronous learner. Much of this information comes from Northeastern Universitys Tips for Taking Online Classes 0.2.1 Productivity During Lockdown 0.3 Knowledge is Power This brief video is covers the icebreaker I do in all of my classes. I encourage you to watch it. In it, I discuss stereotype threats and statistics anxiety. 0.4 Meet Mason 0.5 Website Tour "],["syllabus.html", "Syllabus 0.6 Materials 0.7 Assignment Instructions", " Syllabus You can find the full syllabus on my syllabus git repo. 0.6 Materials 0.6.1 Hardware This class requires that you have a laptop that can run R. 0.6.2 Required Texts The text is intended to supplement the videos, lecture notes, tutorials, activities, and labs. You probably need to consume all of them in order to be successful in this class. Funders Personality Puzzle 8th Edition Ebook version 0.6.3 Software 0.6.3.1 R and RStudio R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows, and MacOS. RStudio is a free integrated development environment (IDE), a powerful user interface for R. 0.6.3.2 Git and Github Git is a version control system. Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects. Git manages the evolution of a set of files  called a repository  in a structured way. Think of it like the Track Changes features from Microsoft Word. Github is a free IDE and hosting service for Git. As a Wake Forest student, you should be able to access the GitHub Student Developer Pack for free. It includes a free PRO upgrade for your github account. 0.7 Assignment Instructions 0.7.1 Portfolio EDA is like basketball. We can watch either being done, and appreciate the art and skill involved in high-level performance. In the hands of Lebron James or Michael Jordan, a basketball is a highly-tuned artistic instrument; in the hands of John Tukey, a graph sings the praises of data in melodies both harmonious and discordant, reflecting model, data, and mood. Part of this course will be devoted to Watching and Studying the master at his work. But basketball is played by thousands of bodies with less than NBA training and ability. Some novice basketball players are just learning their craft, and others will evolve into future LJs and MJs; others have lower aspirations, yet still enjoy participating. So also should EDA be played. A second part of this course will involve learning to do EDA by Doing It. Each of you will be expected to do several EDA projects. These projects will be done during EDA Labs in class, as well as during out-of-class effort. The nature of most of the particular projects will be entirely up to you. You will report to your instructor during EDA Labs on what you have been doing and what you plan to do. You will give a 15-minute individual presentation to the class at the end of the course on what you did in one or two of your major projects. Each project will require some data, to which EDA techniques will be applied. You are welcomed (in fact, strongly encouraged) to use data with which you are currently involved; dissertation or thesis data, a research project, the almanac, data from an article, data from EDA or VDat, data you collect from your family or friends, or data provided to you by your instructor are possible sources. 0.7.2 Additional Ground Rules In this class, I actively encourage you to double dip that is incorporate your research into portfolio pieces and use these pieces in other places. However, I Mason have some ground rules. These rules have been implemented for a variety of reasons, but primarily they are to preserve my sanity by establishing some boundaries. As much as I adore this class, my students (especially you, dear reader!), and everything it stands for  it blurs a lot of lines because often I serve numerous roles while teaching this class. In particular, I may also be your mentor, your committee member, your collaborator, your letter of recommendation writer, your colleague, your confidant, your statistics consultant, your friend, or cat care-taker. I do my best to navigate these roles as best I can. However, for my own sanity, here are my basic rules. For anything that is related to a graduate school milestone (thesis, first year project, major area paper) or something else that youre working with your advisor on you need to actively discuss it with your adviser and get their approval in advance. They may not  and thats okay. If theyre unsure, Im very happy to schedule a quick 30 minute chat with all three of us. My role on anything milestone related is to assist you with the implementation or give you general feedback. I cannot give you advice related to modeling or anything that would merit a discussion about authorship on the final work. I may disagree with something they recommend that you do such as use a specific software that isnt R. (I do have many strong opinions about SPSS and AMOS, as well as modeling choices. However, there is nearly always room for debate in these issues. I try to remind folks that my opinion is just that  an opinion.) For all things related to your research at Wake Forest, please defer to your advisor. Everyone in the department are amazing at what they do. Seriously, each is an expert in their research area  just as I am an expert in R (and genetically-informed designs and strange data). In all likelihood, they know more about the modeling in their specific area. I am very happy to share my expert opinions and I have the privilege to facilitate such conversations through the nature of this class. HOWEVER, please defer to your advisor for all design decisions. I will do my best to tell you when something is outside the scope of the class or if were approaching a gray area. I will not always be successful at navigating this issue. However, I will do my best to do so because I think it is worth the extra challenge. 0.7.2.1 Possible Projects Examples of appropriate portfolio pieces are listed below. I hope some or all of these will be worked on by members of the class. You should develop and work on your projects individually, but discussion with the instructor and others class members is encouraged and in fact expected. Draw plots by hand of some data that are of interest to you, and transform the variables in several different ways. Interpret your results. Choose some data from EDA or VDat; table or plot them in a way that Tukey/Cleveland didnt. Find some population data of interest to you (e.g., North Carolina, Forsyth County,your cat herd, etc.) and do several hand plots like those in Chapter 5 of EDA. Interpret results. Find some data in the World Almanac and plot and/or table them. Use some two-way data, and repeatedly extract the medians like Tukey does in Ch. 10 &amp; 11. Find some time series data, and smooth them in several different ways (see EDA, ch. 7). Data with seasonal patterns are especially interesting (see VDat, pp. 152-172). Write an R, SAS-Graph, SPSS, BASIC, FORTRAN, C, JAVA, or other program to portray influence-enhanced scatterplots. Produce scatterplots of several relationships. Write a BASIC, FORTRAN, C, SAS, SPSS, JAVA, or other program to portray scatter plots on a computer. Give the user the option to plot X and/or Y as either raw data, logs, squares, cubes, reciprocals, roots, etc. Write an R, SAS-Graph, SPSS, BASIC, FORTRAN, C, JAVA or other program to produce some exotic version of stem-and-leaf diagrams. Write a an R, SAS-Graph, SPSS, BASIC, FORTRAN, C, JAVA or other program to plot in three-dimensions with time as one of the dimensions (i.e., a kinostatistical plot). Use R or SAS-Graph or some other dedicated graphical package to plot some interesting data (preferably in color, possibly in 3D, maybe even in higher than 3D). Write an R/SAS routine to do median smoothing by three, and use it on some data. Write an R program, or SAS MACRO or SAS PROC or SAS program to produce some EDA output (but dont duplicate what PROC UNIVARIATE already does). Find an R program in the R library that does interesting EDA; apply it to some interesting data. Produce a correlation matrix between many variables, and develop a scatterplot matrix from it. Read the literature on graphical data analysis and develop some new graphical techniques. Program your techniques. Apply them to real data. Invent a new EDA graphical application, and apply it to real data.

At the end of the course, two things will happen. First, you will give a 12- to 15-minute asynchronous presentation in which you choose one of your EDA projects to describe to the class. Your description should include the goal of the project, the data you used, and a demonstration (PowerPoint, handout, holdup, computer demo, etc.) of the product. 2nd, you will turn in a Portfolio, which consists of two components: A report describing all your projects. The total number depends on the scope and difficulty of each project (as specified in your contract). There may be projects that you dont finish. Thats fine; EDA projects are hardly ever completely finished; write them up anyway. The projects should be numbered consecutively (i.e., in the order in which you began them), and should include for each project a description of the goal, the product (computer program, hand graph, computer graph, etc.), the data, and some interpretation. Reports must be Word Processed and of high quality in terms of writing, grammar, presentation, etc. A prototypical example of the product of each project (e.g., a graph, computer code, etc.). You may wish to put computer output into binders or appendices, graphs into report folders, etc. Portfolios will not be returned; if you wish to have a copy, make one before you turn it in. Portfolios are due the last week of class. Project reports will not be accepted late. Please, no exceptions!!! 0.7.2.3 What is an unessay? An unessay is exactly what the name sounds like. It is not an essay (although it can be one if youd like). What it is is a means to highlight what you have learned. In this class, effectively what that means is that you get to select either a specific portfolio piece or perhaps several of them to highlight what you have learned in this class. 0.7.2.3.1 What makes a good unessay? A good unessay constitutes a critical and active engagement with the course material that shows insight and creativity and demonstrates time and effort devoted to creating something thoughtful. The chosen medium works persuasively with the design and polish of the unessay. The projects structural and formal elements productively serve the core concept of the unessay. The unessay includes a clear and insightful connection between your three choices and reflects a convincing and nuanced thesis. An A unessay come with a clearly stated explanation. This will include your thesis and an explanation of how your unessay responds to the prompt. 0.7.2.4 More Information about contract grading https://marckissel.netlify.app/post/on-the-unessay/ https://esclark.hcommons.org/the-unessay/ https://ryancordell.org/teaching/how-not-to-teach-digital-humanities/ "],["welcome-to-topic.html", "1 Welcome to TOPIC 1.1 Learning Goals 1.2 Module Materials", " 1 Welcome to TOPIC This module introduces you to TOPIC.

The singles Type Q Some charts use a good source of data effectively presented in a visual display. However, the effort fails because of a poorly defined objective, or an unengaging premise. Example: The global liquor consumption chart does a great job with some UN data in a small-multiples presentation but its not clear why the question is interesting. Type D Some designs emerge from well posed and interesting questions, and the graph is well executed. The problem here is the data, which fail to illuminate the question. Typically the data only tangentially concern the topic, or certain adjustments are wanting, or there is a quality concern. Example: NYTs CPI Component Price Drop chart suffers from over-processed data but the chart is well-executed and the question being addressed is important and relevant. Type V Despite having a good data source and an interesting, well-posed problem, the visual design hides or confuses the message. These charts have long provided fodder for Tufte, Wainer and the like. Example: Arctic Ice Death Spiral concerns an existential problem, and as far as I know, the data are standard fare but the chart fails because of the spiral design. "],["doubles.html", "42 2. Doubles", " 42 2. Doubles Type QD The graphical elements follow best practices, and present the data well. This effort is in vain, because of poor data quality, and an unclear objective. Example: NYTs Mirth and Taxes scatter plot has commendable production values but this difficult problem is tough to nail down, and finding good data is hard. Type QV The data has been properly collected and processed. However, the question being addressed has not been clearly defined, and the graphical design fails to bring out the key features of the data. Example: New York City 311 Calls by the hour visualizes a good dataset but its hard to know what the motivating question is, the insights are mundane, and further confused by the use of the streamgraph. Type DV An interesting question has been posed. The data fail to convince, and the cause is not helped by poor execution of the graphical elements. Example: The chart about the unfulfilled promise of long-tail music sales draws us in with a nice question but the data do not give a good answer, and the visual elements are poorly executed.

When you hit the Submit Answer button, every line of code is interpreted and executed by R and you get a message whether or not your code was correct. The output of your R code is shown in the console in the lower right corner. R makes use of the # sign to add comments, so that you and others can understand what the R code is about. Just like Twitter! Comments are not run as R code, so they will not influence your result. For example, Calculate 3 + 4 in the editor on the right is a comment. You can also execute R commands straight in the console. This is a good way to experiment with R code, as your submission is not checked for correctness. @instructions - In the editor on the right there is already some sample code. Can you see which lines are actual R code and which are comments? - Add a line of code that calculates the sum of 6 and 12, and hit the Submit Answer button. @hint Just add a line of R code that calculates the sum of 6 and 12, just like the example in the sample code! @pre_exercise_code @sample_code ## [1] 7 @solution ## [1] 7 ## [1] 18 ## Arithmetic with R yaml type: NormalExercise xp: 100 skills: 1 key: 720745eda5 In its most basic form, R can be used as a simple calculator. Consider the following arithmetic operators: - Addition: + - Subtraction: - - Multiplication: * - Division: / - Exponentiation: ^ - Modulo: %% The last two might need some explaining: - The ^ operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right: for example 3^2 is 9. - The modulo returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right, for example 5 modulo 3 or 5 %% 3 is 2. With this knowledge, follow the instructions below to complete the exercise. @instructions - Type 2^5 in the editor to calculate 2 to the power 5. - Type 28 %% 6 to calculate 28 modulo 6. - Click Submit Answer and have a look at the R output in the console. - Note how the # symbol is used to add comments on the R code. @hint Another example of the modulo operator: 9 %% 2 equals 1. @pre_exercise_code @sample_code ## [1] 10 ## [1] 0 ## [1] 15 ## [1] 5 @solution ## [1] 10 ## [1] 0 ## [1] 15 ## [1] 5 ## [1] 32 ## [1] 4 44.2 Variable assignment type: NormalExercise xp: 100 skills: 1 key: 5f200ffd43 A basic concept in (statistical) programming is called a variable. A variable allows you to store a value (e.g. 4) or an object (e.g. a function description) in R. You can then later use this variables name to easily access the value or the object that is stored within this variable. You can assign a value 4 to a variable my_var with the command my_var &lt;- 4 @instructions Over to you: complete the code in the editor such that it assigns the value 42 to the variable x in the editor. Click Submit Answer. Notice that when you ask R to print x, the value 42 appears. @hint Look at how the value 4 was assigned to my_variable in the exercises assignment. Do the exact same thing in the editor, but now assign 42 to the variable x. @pre_exercise_code @sample_code ## [1] 42 @solution ## [1] 42 ## Variable assignment (2) yaml type: NormalExercise xp: 100 skills: 1 key: c5944b90eb Suppose you have a fruit basket with five apples. As a data analyst in training, you want to store the number of apples in a variable with the name my_apples. @instructions - Type the following code in the editor: my_apples &lt;- 5. This will assign the value 5 to my_apples. - Type: my_apples below the second comment. This will print out the value of my_apples. - Click Submit Answer, and look at the console: you see that the number 5 is printed. So R now links the variable my_apples to the value 5. @hint Remember that if you want to assign a number or an object to a variable in R, you can make use of the assignment operator &lt;-. Alternatively, you can use =, but &lt;- is widely preferred in the R community. @pre_exercise_code @sample_code @solution ## [1] 5 44.3 Variable assignment (3) type: NormalExercise xp: 100 skills: 1 key: 1c1bd25045 Every tasty fruit basket needs oranges, so you decide to add six oranges. As a data analyst, your reflex is to immediately create the variable my_oranges and assign the value 6 to it. Next, you want to calculate how many pieces of fruit you have in total. Since you have given meaningful names to these values, you can now code this in a clear way: my_apples + my_oranges @instructions - Assign to my_oranges the value 6. - Add the variables my_apples and my_oranges and have R simply print the result. - Assign the result of adding my_apples and my_oranges to a new variable my_fruit. @hint my_fruit is just the sum of my_apples and my_oranges. You can use the + operator to sum the two and &lt;- to assign that value to the variable my_fruit. @pre_exercise_code @sample_code @solution ## [1] 11 ## Apples and oranges yaml type: NormalExercise xp: 100 skills: 1 key: 915fcc7c99 Common knowledge tells you not to add apples and oranges. But hey, that is what you just did, no :-)? The my_apples and my_oranges variables both contained a number in the previous exercise. The + operator works with numeric variables in R. If you really tried to add apples and oranges, and assigned a text value to the variable my_oranges (see the editor), you would be trying to assign the addition of a numeric and a character variable to the variable my_fruit. This is not possible. @instructions - Click Submit Answer and read the error message. Make sure to understand why this did not work. - Adjust the code so that R knows you have 6 oranges and thus a fruit basket with 11 pieces of fruit. @hint You have to assign the numeric value 6 to the my_oranges variable instead of the character value \"six\". Note how the quotation marks are used to indicate that \"six\" is a character. @pre_exercise_code @sample_code @solution ## [1] 11 44.4 Basic data types in R type: NormalExercise xp: 100 skills: 1 key: 0f23107394 R works with numerous data types. Some of the most basic types to get started are: Decimal values like 4.5 are called numerics. Natural numbers like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numerics. Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical. Text (or string) values are called characters. Note how the quotation marks on the right indicate that some text is a character. @instructions Change the value of the: my_numeric variable to 42. my_character variable to \"universe\". Note that the quotation marks indicate that \"universe\" is a character. my_logical variable to FALSE. Note that R is case sensitive! @hint Replace the values in the editor with the values that are provided in the exercise. For example: my_numeric &lt;- 42 assigns the value 42 to the variable my_numeric. @pre_exercise_code @sample_code @solution 44.5 Whats that data type? type: NormalExercise xp: 100 skills: 1 key: 99b549229d Do you remember that when you added 5 + \"six\", you got an error due to a mismatch in data types? You can avoid such embarrassing situations by checking the data type of a variable beforehand. You can do this with the class() function, as the code on the right shows. @instructions Complete the code in the editor and also print out the classes of my_character and my_logical. @hint The code that prints the data type of my_numeric is already included; do a similar things for my_character and my_logical. @pre_exercise_code @sample_code ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; @solution ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; ## [1] &quot;character&quot; ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; "]]
